  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>My name is Fitsum Shewangizaw. I have a nick name that my parents used to call me Girum. 
    I grow up in Addis Ababa. I was born and raised in Addis Ababa. Now, I live in Gondar for 
    educational purposes, but I am still living in Addis Ababa. I can speak Amharic, English, 
    and a little bit of Gurage. If I had to describe my personality in three words, I would say: 
    quiet, intelligent, and kind. To me, a cultural or family event that has great meaning is a 
    ceremony that brings people together, whether in times of joy or sorrow.</p>

    <p>Now I'm currently studying field of information science at university of gondar. My dream job is to major in 
    information science and become a data analyst. Along with this, I am also looking into 
    other career fields such as web developer, network administrator, or system administrator. 
    I recently started a website development course. It is a very interesting and exciting course. 
    I have taught elementary English to fifth grade students and I had a wonderful time with the 
    students. I enjoy reading books. Climbing mountains, admiring nature, going to church, 
    and singing are some of my most fulfilling experiences. I'm more of a thinker, a 
    creator and a connector. I prefer to work alone when I need the most concentration. 
    But I also enjoy working with others. I enjoy solving problems for people around me.</p>
    
    
    <p>My mother is the most important person in my life. Being able to immediately and clearly 
    state what you want, what you can do, or what you can't do is a quality I look for in 
    other people. I appreciate emotional support. It means a lot to me when people give me 
    constructive and encouraging feedback. My biggest goal is to leave my legacy by creating 
    inclusive technology projects for all segments of society in my country, Ethiopia, and around the world. You can contact me <a href="./contact.html">here.</a></p>
